# Project Rules

## Frontend Work

- All frontend implementation (components, pages, layouts, styling) **must** use the `frontend-design` skill. Never generate frontend code without invoking it first.

## Third-Party Libraries

- Before using or implementing any third-party library, **always** use Context7 MCP first to fetch and read the library's current documentation. Understand the correct API patterns, configuration, and best practices from the actual docs before writing any code. Do not rely on training data for library usage — verify against live documentation.

## Authorship

- Never add "Claude", "AI", or any AI assistant name as an author in any file, commit message, frontmatter, comment, or metadata. Use the project author name (Melchizedek) where authorship is required.
