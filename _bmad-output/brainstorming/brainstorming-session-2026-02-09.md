# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Melchizedek
**Date:** 2026-02-09

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Minstrel - An AI-powered interactive practice companion for instrumentalists. Users connect via MIDI to receive real-time analysis of notes, chords, and progressions. The platform detects mistakes, recommends improvements, generates practice drills, boosts creativity, and provides an interactive AI coaching conversation grounded in session context. Adaptive difficulty keeps it fun and challenging without discouraging the player.

**Goals:**
- Real-time MIDI analysis of every note, chord, and progression
- Mistake detection and correction with explanations
- Personalized practice drills targeting weak areas
- AI coaching conversation (natural questions about playing)
- Adaptive difficulty that balances challenge and fun
- Creativity boosting (voicings, substitutions, passing chords)
- Session-aware context for all advice

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** Hybrid AI-Recommended + Creative Innovation Blend

**Selected Techniques (7-Phase Power Session):**

1. **Role Playing** (Collaborative) — Embody different musician personas to discover needs from every angle
2. **First Principles** (Creative) — Strip to what musicians fundamentally need to improve
3. **What If Scenarios** (Creative) — Explode constraints and dream big
4. **SCAMPER Method** (Structured) — Systematically innovate each feature through 7 lenses

## Technique Execution Results

### Phase 1: Role Playing — User Personas

**Three personas explored: Jake (beginner), Aisha (classically trained), Marcus (pro)**

**[Persona #1]: Jake — The Self-Taught Beginner (17, guitarist)**
_Concept_: First experience should flow naturally: Free Play → Skill Assessment → Guided Challenge as a seamless onboarding sequence, not a forced funnel
_Key Decisions_:
- Retention through ALL channels: streaks/XP, unfinished challenges, personalized playlists, social proof
- Error handling is LAYERED and contextual: gentle real-time nudge + post-phrase review + adaptive difficulty drop + coach explanation — Minstrel picks the right response based on the moment
_Novelty_: Error response is not one-size-fits-all — it's a smart escalation system

**[Persona #2]: Aisha — The Creatively Stuck Classical Player (25, pianist)**
_Concept_: All four creativity tools are core pillars: improv sandbox, theory-to-creativity bridge, style morphing, guided deconstruction
_Key Decisions_: Minstrel's creativity engine is a MAJOR differentiator, not a nice-to-have
_Novelty_: Bridging classical training to improvisation — helping players use what they already know in new ways

**[Persona #3]: Marcus — The Gigging Pro (40, jazz bassist)**
_Concept_: Pros want mirrors, not teachers — session analytics and weakness hunting
_Key Decisions_: Deep stats (timing accuracy to milliseconds, harmonic tendencies, over-relied comfort zones) and AI that identifies patterns the player avoids
_Novelty_: "You never use diminished substitutions over V chords" — targeted mastery gap identification

**[Critical Scope Decision]: Sofia (teacher) — REJECTED**
_Decision_: Minstrel is for PLAYERS, not teachers. Individual practice companion, not a teaching platform. This sharpens product focus enormously.

---

### Phase 2: First Principles — Core Truths

**[Core Truth #1]: Progressive Challenge**
_Concept_: The single most fundamental thing a musician needs is to always be playing slightly above their level. Too easy = boredom, too hard = frustration.
_Novelty_: Minstrel's secret sauce is the difficulty curve — keeping the player in flow state

**[Core Truth #2]: Private Tutor Replacement**
_Concept_: Minstrel replaces the expert who listens, corrects, and guides — but costs $50-100/hr and isn't available at 11pm
_Novelty_: Positioning as tutor replacement, not tool. This is a relationship, not a utility.

**[Core Truth #3]: Full-Stack MVP**
_Concept_: MVP includes Listen + Analyze + Coach + Drill + Challenge as a complete loop. The MIDI listening engine is the foundation everything else is built on.
_Novelty_: Ambitious MVP — not a stripped-down demo, but the complete core experience from day one

---

### Phase 3: What If Scenarios — Expanding Boundaries

**[Expansion #1]: Audio + MIDI Hybrid**
_Concept_: Use the laptop mic alongside MIDI to capture tone quality, dynamics, articulation — things MIDI can't convey (how hard, how smooth, vibrato)
_Novelty_: Major differentiator over competitors that only do MIDI — captures the FEEL of playing, not just the notes

**[Expansion #2]: No Social Features**
_Concept_: Minstrel is a deeply personal tool. Solo practice sanctuary. No social layer.
_Novelty_: Deliberately anti-social — simplifies the product enormously and keeps focus tight

**[Expansion #3]: AI Music Generation — Triple Threat**
_Concept_: Three generation capabilities: custom exercise generation (never the same drill twice), song completion (play a melody, get chords/arrangement suggestions), style transfer (hear your passage as bossa nova, metal, etc.)
_Novelty_: Minstrel goes from "tool" to "creative partner" through generation

---

### Phase 4: SCAMPER Method — Systematic Innovation

**[S - Substitute]: Anti-School Session Structure**
_Concept_: Two modes — Micro-sessions (3-5 minute focused bursts, stackable) and Freeform + AI Interrupts (just play, Minstrel only speaks when it notices something worth addressing)
_Novelty_: No lessons, no curriculum structure — pure adaptive practice

**[C - Combine]: Two Killer Combinations**
_Concept_: (1) Mistake detection + instant drill generation — every mistake spawns a 30-second targeted drill in the moment. (2) Real-time analysis + AI chat — ask Minstrel questions mid-session: "What chord was that? Why did it sound jazzy?"
_Novelty_: Fix mistakes in the moment, not later. Conversational during play.

**[A - Adapt]: Four Industry Blueprints**
_Concept_: Adapt Duolingo's streaks (meaningful practice, not just app opens), Spotify's Discover Weekly (weekly style discovery sessions), fitness tracker zones (Comfort/Growth/Stretch zone indicators), chess engine post-session analysis (replay with "best move" suggestions)
_Novelty_: Proven engagement patterns transplanted into music practice

**[M - Modify]: Minimal & Subtle AI Personality**
_Concept_: Minstrel shows data and suggestions but doesn't "talk" much. The music speaks, not the AI. Data-driven, not personality-driven.
_Novelty_: Anti-chatty coach. Mirror and nudge, not a character.

**[P - Put to Other Uses]: N/A — skipped for focus**

**[E - Eliminate]: The Four Nots**
_Concept_: NO sheet music display (teaches by ear and feel), NO pre-built curriculum (every path is dynamically generated), NO competitive scoring (progress is personal only), NO video content (YouTube already has a billion lessons)
_Novelty_: Aggressively opinionated product — Minstrel is the anti-school practice room

**[R - Reverse]: Rejected**
_Decision_: No reverse teaching dynamic. Minstrel teaches the player, period. Clean one-directional value flow.

### Phase 5: Cross-Pollination — Borrowed Brilliance

**[From Fitness #1]: Progressive Overload**
_Concept_: Systematically increase difficulty by small increments — tempo +2 BPM, add one note to the phrase, shift key
_Novelty_: Musical weightlifting — measurable, incremental, unstoppable growth

**[From Fitness #2]: Personal Records**
_Concept_: "Your fastest clean run of this arpeggio was 140 BPM on Jan 5" — concrete progress markers you can chase
_Novelty_: Quantified musical progress with specific benchmarks

**[From Fitness #3]: Warm-up Routines**
_Concept_: Auto-generated warm-ups before practice based on what you're about to work on
_Novelty_: Smart session prep — like dynamic stretching before a workout

**[From Gaming #1]: Skill Trees**
_Concept_: Visual progression map — "Chord Mastery" branches into "Jazz Voicings", "Spread Voicings", "Shell Voicings" — unlock paths
_Novelty_: Visual representation of musical growth with branching specializations

**[From Gaming #2]: Achievements/Badges**
_Concept_: "First Jazz Voicing", "100 Days Streak", "Perfect Timing 10x in a Row" — dopamine-driven milestones
_Novelty_: Gamified progress markers without competitive pressure (personal only)

**[From Gaming #3]: Difficulty Settings**
_Concept_: Easy/Normal/Hard for every exercise — same musical concept at different complexity levels
_Novelty_: Player agency in challenge level alongside the Difficulty Engine's auto-adjustment

**[From Coaching #1]: Growth Mindset Framing**
_Concept_: Never say "wrong" — say "not yet." Frame all feedback as progress, not failure. Psychological safety in every interaction.
_Novelty_: Language design as a core product principle

---

### Phase 6: Concept Blending — Fused Features

**[Fused Feature #1]: The Difficulty Engine**
_Concept_: One invisible unified system that controls ALL difficulty across Minstrel — tempo, complexity, key, rhythm — always keeping the player in the growth zone. Not individual drill settings — a single intelligence governing the entire experience.
_Novelty_: This is the BRAIN of Minstrel. Every feature defers to this engine for challenge calibration.

**[Fused Feature #2]: Multi-Modal Interaction Layers**
_Concept_: Four interaction modes as layers of the same experience:
- **Silent Coach** (during play) — real-time data visualization, AI only speaks when asked
- **Margin Notes** (post-session) — performance as annotated document, click any moment for deeper questions
- **Dashboard + Chat** (active questioning) — split screen with live data and conversational AI
- **Replay Studio** (deep dive) — scrub timeline of recorded session, ask AI about any moment
_Novelty_: Not competing modes but a layered experience — different depths for different moments

**[Fused Feature #3]: Style DNA Profile**
_Concept_: Minstrel maps the player's musical personality (70% jazz, 20% classical, 10% blues) — but ONLY introduces new styles with user consent or on request. Never pushes players out of comfort zone uninvited.
_Novelty_: Respects player autonomy — discovery is opt-in, consistent with minimal/subtle philosophy

---

### Phase 7: Chaos Engineering — Stress Testing

**[Chaos #1]: Latency Handling**
_Concept_: Three-layer defense: (1) Auto-compensate silently for minor latency, (2) Warn and guide user to fix audio settings for significant latency, (3) Fall back to record-then-analyze mode if real-time isn't viable
_Novelty_: Graceful degradation — never a broken experience, just different levels of real-time feedback

**[Chaos #2]: Total Beginner (Unrecognizable Playing)**
_Concept_: Two-pronged approach: (1) Find SOMETHING positive — "You're using 3 different fingers, great hand independence!" (2) Drop to absolute zero — "Play just this ONE note when I light it up"
_Novelty_: No floor too low — Minstrel meets you at literal zero and builds from there

**[Chaos #3]: Plateau Detection & Intervention**
_Concept_: Two strategies: (1) Data confrontation — show the flatline ("Your accuracy has been 87% for 18 days. Want to try a different approach?"), (2) Subtle variation — silently modify the exercise (change key, shift rhythm, add a note) to break autopilot
_Novelty_: Honest data + invisible nudges — respects intelligence while preventing stagnation

**[Chaos #4]: Genre-Aware AI**
_Concept_: Minstrel MUST know what genre/style the player is working in and constrain ALL advice to that context. No suggesting major 7th chords in blues, no classical fingering advice for jazz players.
_Novelty_: Genre is not a tag — it's a fundamental constraint on every piece of advice Minstrel gives

## Product Philosophy (Emerged from Session)

**Minstrel is:**
- A private tutor replacement, available 24/7
- An ear-first, interactive practice sanctuary
- Minimal, subtle, data-driven — the music speaks, not the AI
- Aggressively anti-school: no sheets, no curriculum, no videos, no competition
- Deeply personal: no social features, solo practice only
- Genre-aware in every interaction
- Built on "not yet" — never "wrong"

**Minstrel's Core Systems:**
1. **MIDI + Audio Listening Engine** — the foundation (bidirectional — input AND output)
2. **MIDI Playback / Demonstration Engine** — Minstrel plays notes back through the user's instrument speakers to demonstrate drills, runs, arpeggios, and correct phrasing before the user attempts them. Teaching loop: Demonstrate → Listen → Attempt → Analyze → Correct → Repeat.
3. **The Difficulty Engine** — unified challenge intelligence
4. **AI Generation Engine** — custom drills, song completion, style transfer
5. **Multi-Modal Interaction** — Silent Coach → Margin Notes → Dashboard + Chat → Replay Studio
6. **Style DNA Profile** — musical personality mapping (opt-in discovery)

**Minstrel is NOT:**
- A teaching platform (no teacher mode)
- A social network
- A sheet music reader
- A video lesson library
- A competitive platform
- A chatty personality
